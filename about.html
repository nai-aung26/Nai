        <p>Hi there!</p>
	<p>My name is Sai Aung and I’m 22 years old. I was born and raised in Myanmar. I have one younger sister. I arrived United State on September 2016.</p>
	<p>I was 20 years old when I arrived USA. International Rescue Committee (IRC) helped me for resettlement in Atlanta, GA.  After I arrived a month, IRC help me to get into high school. They took me to the place where I can take ESL and math test and they gave me 9th grade at Druid Hill high school. I felt I can do better than that so after 2 weeks went to high school and I decided to be laid out. The reason was I don’t want to spend 4 years High school to get High School Diploma. Also, the other side I need to help my parents. After I laid out High school, I took ESL evening class to improve my English skill and math practice on weekend. I also worked part-time at Café Alsace Decatur.
